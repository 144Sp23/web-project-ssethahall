        <h1>Resolution</h1>
        <p>The real question is how can we protect these beautiful animals from going extinct, as many of them have already? The only real way to save them - aside from keeping them all in captivity, which should of course only be the last resort if their natural habitat is too dangerous - is to protect their territories and block them off from human interaction. This would protect their territories as well as protect the habitats of the animals they prey on for food, and keep them out of the way of any humans who might do them harm.</p>

<p>Researching, spreading awareness of their speciesâ€™ critical status, and donating to conservation efforts are all great ways that even your everyday person can help save the tigers.
