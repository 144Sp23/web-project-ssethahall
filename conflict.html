        <h1>Conflict</h1>
        <p>The antagonist of our tigersâ€™ story is - no surprise - humankind. Specifically habitat destruction, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deforestation</li>
            <li>Pollution</li>
            <li>Removal of prey animals from tiger territory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No surprise here, though. Most endangered species - big cats or not - face extinction because of this same list of manmade dangers, give or take a few. Another factor common for predator animals like tigers is people hunting them, sometimes for their fur, but often to protect themselves, their families, or their livestock. If there were ever a reason to hunt a tiger, that would be the best one. However, it's done a number on the population, and getting rid of too many predators in the wild will lead to an overflow of prey animals and upset the ecosystem, which could have even worse effects on the people living in the area than a couple hungry tigers.</p>
